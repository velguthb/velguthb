									<p>My research is centered around analyzing the stellar halos and tidal streams of galaxies in the Local Volume to understand 
										aspects of their evolutionary history. My favorite part of these experiences has been age dating these diffuse stellar structures, 
										helping to introduce the dimension of time to our understanding of galactic merger events. The majority of this has been centered 
										around the M81 group, using data from the Subaru Telescope's Hyper-SuprimeCam and the Hubble Space Telescope.
									</p>

									<p>I am interested in continuing this research in graduate school. I love analyzing the small pieces of galaxies to understand the big 
										picture of how these structures form and evolve. All of the experience I have in this field has been through looking at resolved stellar 
										populations, but would love to branch out into looking at gas, dust, black holes, AGN, or any other constituent piece of a galaxy that 
										contributes to its continued growth and evolution.

											<h3>The Stellar Halos and Tidal Streams of M82 and NGC 3077</h3>
											<p>In the summer of 2023, I began applying the methods used to find the end of star formation in F8D1 to the stellar halos of M82 and 
												NGC 3077. These two galaxies, also in the M81 group, are known to be interacting with M81 itself. However, we do now know when 
												these two galaxies fell into the group or how this infall affected their morphologies or star foramtion histories. 
												This work is weeks away from submission, so stay tuned.

											<h3>Star Formation Regulation in AGN and Non-AGN Sipral Galaxies</h3>
											<p>During May of 2023, I had the privlidge of living at Kitt Peak National Observatory as part of a unique class offered at UMich. Part of this class was a self directed research project, in which pairs of students picked what to observe, wrote a proposal for telescope time, performed observations, and analyzed and presented the results. My partner and I chose to compare the stellar mass fractions of nearby AGN and non-AGN spirals, to see if we could detect a difference in stellar mass between these two populations. We were able to reproduce the theoretical predictions of stellar mass fractions for galaxies in the mass range we observed, but could not detect a difference between the AGN and non-AGN galaxies. A link to the poster we made for this project can be found on my Presentations page.</p>

											<h3>F8D1</h3>
											<p>F8D1 holds a special place in my heart, as it is the galaxy that led to my passion for learning about galactic interactions and mergers. This galaxy is an Ultra-Diffuse Galaxy (UDG) at the outskirts of the M81 group, and exhibits an intersting set of characteristics. UDGs generally are thought to have little to no recent star formation, I have found evidence that this galaxy had a burst of star formation roughly 2 Gyr ago, corresponding to its most recent pericentric passage around its host. This is currently being incorperated into a paper led by Dr. Adam Smercina, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Washington. Various posters, presentations, and talks that I have given on this galaxy can be found on my Presentations page. </p>
